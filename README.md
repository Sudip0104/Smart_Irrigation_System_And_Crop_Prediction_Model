# Smart_Irrigation_System_And_Crop_Prediction_Model

Climate change has intensified water scarcity, making irrigation optimization a critical challenge in agriculture.

The proposed **smart irrigation system** integrates an _Arduino microcontroller_, _environmental sensors_, and _machine learning (ML)_ to enhance water use efficiency.

Sensors measure soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors to determine the precise amount of water needed.

The system automatically communicates with pumps and valves through the Arduino controller, ensuring water is supplied at the right time and in the required amount.

A machine learning algorithm is employed to predict crop yield by analyzing real-time sensor data.

The algorithm uses a supervised learning approach, trained on historical crop yield and environmental datasets, to build a reliable predictive model.

Once trained, the model can provide real-time predictions about crop needs and expected yield, supporting better irrigation management.

The system is versatile and flexible, adaptable to different crops and diverse agricultural environments.

Benefits include optimized irrigation water use, minimized waste, and enhanced crop yield prediction.

Overall, this approach provides a sustainable, smart, and effective solution to address water scarcity in modern agriculture.
